Introduction
------------

I have never thought that my first serious project would be developing an R package (see [here](https://github.com/sparktseung/LRMoE)). The experience was painful, to say the least, considering I was not quite the programmer in the first place.

* Setting up the environment;
* Package debugging and testing;
* Speeding up R code; 
* Passing the CRAN test; and
* Looking forward.
